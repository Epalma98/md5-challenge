This is a todo calendar that shows a user's written todos in time blocks that are color coded to let the user know if the todo has passed or has yet to come.

## Description
I was tasked with creating a calendar that saves written text/todos in the local storage which can then be retrieved and displayed if the page were to be reloaded.

The calendar also uses DayJs to present a live clock in the header. Using Javascript, the webpage compares the current time with the calendars timeblocks and depending if the timeblock is past, present, or future, they will be colored either gray (past), red (present), or future (green).

## Installation
1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the main page (index.html) on your browser to view webpage
3. Use a text editor to view all coding.
   

## Usage
Once the webpage is loaded up for the first time, the user should be presented with blank time blocks. After wrtting a todo or note in the timeblock, click the save button on the right side. By doing so, the user is saving the text into the local storage.

The text can be update by typing in a new entry and clicking save again.

If the page were to be reloaded, the text woukd be retrieved upon reloading.
